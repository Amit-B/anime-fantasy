# Anime Fantasy
SA-MP is an online mod for the game GTA San Andreas.
Anime Fantasy is my old project which I've been working on since 2013; I've been developing and scripting it once a month as a hobby, and now it's the time to let the project go. I don't believe it can success with the current SA-MP community scale so I'm releasing it.

The project is a platform that allows a developer to create game modes for SA-MP which will be based on anime and will be completely like a whole new game. Along with the platform itselfs I'm also releasing the first and the only gamemode based on this platform, which is Naruto World, based on Naruto Shippuden.

Note that there is also a web platform which contains web service used by the platform and game skins / sounds / animations / etc. These are too big to upload.
